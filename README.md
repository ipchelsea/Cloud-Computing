# Cloud-Computing

# Backup Cloud

Purpose
The programmable Web and cloud is built on HTTP. In this lab we will utilize HTTP
programming to “GET” and crawl parts of the HTML based Web. The goal is to familiarize
students with HTTP and programmatically using it to access the web. Of course, the majority
of the access to the Cloud is done using APIs and development environments which target
specific services, these are built on HTTP.

Problem Statement
Create an application which takes two arguments:
1) A URL as a starting point
2) The number of hops from that URL (NumHops)


# Spider Crawler

Purpose
This exercise will introduce the student to using cloud storage programmable APIS.

Problem Statement
Create an application which recursively traverses the files of a directory and makes a backup to
the cloud. You will use the cloud storage APIS to do this.

# Lambda

# Purpose
This programming assignment will introduce the student to using multiple services in the cloud
working together. In particular the student will use S3 or Blob Storage, DynamoDB or Azure
Tables or CosmosDB, and website technology which allows server side code (ASP.Net, MVC,
etc…).

# Problem Statement / Overview
Create and host a Website which has three sections:
1) A button call Load Data
2) A button call Clear Data
3) Two input text boxes labeled First Name and Last Name
4) A button called Query
